The worst case for quicksort with a single pivot point is when only one element is removed.
This would work such that only one element is lost each time a partition is found.
Therefore, you would have to sort all the elements, everytime you remove an element, which is O(n^2).

For middle pivot, this would happen if the middle element is always the largest pivot.

This would be achieved with the array:
[1,3,5,7,8,6,4,2]
